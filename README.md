# Curbon 
An application created by Invictus Technology, Monash University. This app is aimed to help students to be aware of carbon emissions. We are aiming for a net-zero carbon emission. Curbon helps students to track, monitor, and learn from their previous trips, how much they are emitting. It will provide tips along the way for students to reduce their carbon emission


## Getting Started
